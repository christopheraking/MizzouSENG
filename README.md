##Different visualizations are in different branches

###Kevin Free ~ kcfk28
For my visualization I took the original layout, added the Democratic results to the bottom of the page, added titles, and aligned the perentage bars with two decimal place percentages for a cleaner look.

###Kate Watkins ~ kyw356
For my changes, I wanted to clean up the API by aligning the graph and text. I aligned everything to the left, put the % sign on the left side of the text, and put ( ) sround the percentage so its easier to read. I also added a title, making it bigger and underlined.
